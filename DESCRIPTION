Description: We have the code for
	     disaggregation as found in Wei and Stram
	     (1990, <doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1990.tb01799.x>),
	     and Hodgess and Wei (1996, "Temporal Disaggregation of Time
	     Series" in Statistical Science I, Nova Publishing).  The disaggregation models have different orders
	     of the moving average component.  These are based on ARIMA
	     models rather than differencing or using similar time series.
